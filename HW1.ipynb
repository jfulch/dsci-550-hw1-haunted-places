Air Pollution Data\n\n**Source:** Regional Air Quality Data \n**URL1:** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/regional-air-quality-data (metadata source is in JSON format)\n**URL2:** EPA.gov - https://www.epa.gov/castnet/download-data (zip files are in excel CSV format)\n**MIME Type:** application/json, text/csv, application/csv\n**Reasoning:** Carbon monoxide poisoning causes hallucinations (and has been a common explanation for hauntings/supernatural activity). Might be able to do something similar with areas experiencing high levels of air pollution. Can replace this with a carbon monoxide poisoning dataset if we come across one.\n**Features:**\n1. Ozone (O₃) Concentration\n - **Description:** Represents the levels of ground-level ozone, a major air pollutant that affects human health and visibility.\n- **Hypothesis:** High ozone levels can lead to eye irritation, headaches, and breathing difficulties, which may cause people to misinterpret their physical symptoms as supernatural encounters. Additionally, ozone is linked to electrical storms and atmospheric disturbances, which could contribute to eerie environments where ghost sightings are reported.\n- **Additional Data Source:** EPA CASTNET Ozone Levels, which provide detailed data on regional ozone concentrations.\n- **Query to use:** Are ghost sightings more frequent in locations with high ozone concentrations, suggesting that atmospheric conditions may influence perceived hauntings?\n\n2. Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂) Concentration\n- **Description:** Measures the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air, which is commonly associated with industrial emissions and volcanic activity. It has a distinct, pungent smell and can cause respiratory discomfort and irritation.\n- **Hypothesis:** High levels of SO₂ exposure can cause dizziness, headaches, and difficulty breathing, potentially contributing to eerie or otherworldly sensations experienced in haunted locations. It may also create a sulfuric odor, often linked in folklore to demonic or paranormal activity.\n- **Additional Data Source:** EPA CASTNET SO₂ Levels, which provide historical sulfur dioxide measurements at different monitoring stations across the U.S.\n- **Query to use:** Are haunted locations with stronger ghostly activity correlated with higher SO₂ levels, indicating possible environmental effects influencing supernatural experiences?\n3. Particulate Matter Composition\n- **Description:** Measures the concentration of airborne particulate matter, including sulfates, nitrates, and ammonium, which can reduce visibility and affect human health.\n- **Hypothesis:** High levels of particulate pollution can lead to \"visual distortions\" like haze or fog, which may be mistaken for paranormal apparitions such as ghostly figures or floating orbs. Additionally, fine particulates can impact neurological function, potentially leading to hallucinations or altered perceptions in certain individuals.\n- **Additional Data Source:** EPA CASTNET Particulate Matter (PM) Levels, which include sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations.\n- **Query to use:** Do haunted locations with a history of spectral apparitions coincide with higher levels of particulate pollution, suggesting that air quality impacts the visibility and perception of supernatural events?","block_group":"a41b371c3b664f53826505a626084ce6"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"4d4585c0","execution_start":1740028383632,"execution_millis":174832,"execution_context_id":"1b279c0e-3755-4fbe-9e45-1002722f38d6","cell_id":"a3a02a4e9924492386b836945424d60b","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import os\nimport re\nimport zipfile\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\nimport urllib3\n\n# Suppress SSL warning messages\nurllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)\n\n# EPA CASTNET Data Directory\nEPA_DATA_URL = \"https://gaftp.epa.gov/castnet/CASTNET_Outgoing/data/\"\nOUTPUT_CSV = \"/work/Exports/air pollution data/air_pollution_data.csv\"\nDATA_FOLDER = \"/work/Exports/air pollution data/castnet_data\"\nEXTRACT_FOLDER = \"/work/Exports/air pollution data/extracted_data\"\n\n# Ensure directories exist\nos.makedirs(DATA_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)\nos.makedirs(EXTRACT_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)\n\ndef get_zip_links(base_url):\n    \"\"\"Web scrapes the FTP directory for ZIP file links.\"\"\"\n    response = requests.get(base_url, verify=False)  #

hallucinations that can be easily misinterpreted as supernatural activity\n**Features:**\n1. TBI-Related Emergency Department (ED) Visit Rates\n - **Description:** This feature represents the rate of emergency department visits due to traumatic brain injuries per 100,000 individuals.\n- **Hypothesis:** Higher rates of TBI-related ED visits in a region may correlate with increased reports of supernatural activity, as individuals with TBIs might experience symptoms such as hallucinations or altered perceptions, leading to misinterpretations of events as paranormal.\n- **Additional Data Source:** Rates of TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths - United States, 2001–2010.\n- **Query to use:** Analyze whether regions with higher TBI-related ED visit rates have a corresponding increase in reported haunted locations.\n2. TBI-Related Hospitalization Rates\n- **Description:** This feature indicates the rate of hospitalizations due to traumatic brain injuries per 100,000 individuals.\n- **Hypothesis:** Elevated hospitalization rates for TBIs might suggest a population with a higher prevalence of severe brain injuries, potentially leading to cognitive or sensory disturbances that could be perceived as supernatural experiences.\n- **Additional Data Source:** Rates of TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths - United States, 2001–2010.\n- **Query to use:** Investigate the relationship between TBI-related hospitalization rates and the frequency of ghost sightings or haunted place reports in various regions.\n3. TBI-Related Mortality Rates\n- **Description:** This feature denotes the rate of deaths attributed to traumatic brain injuries per 100,000 individuals.\n- **Hypothesis:** Regions with higher TBI-related mortality rates may have communities experiencing grief and trauma, potentially leading to an increased belief in or reporting of supernatural occurrences as a coping mechanism.\n- **Additional Data Source:** Rates of TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths - United States, 2001–2010.\n- **Question to use:** Examine if there's a correlation between TBI-related death rates and the number of haunted places reported in those areas.","block_group":"3bc027e790484308bb1805c5e8f1d4d3"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"795eed16","execution_start":1739859148146,"execution_millis":750,"execution_context_id":"e6e1c265-11f7-4eb8-9046-299549870cc0","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"0039be76e2c54c79a3f880fc23ea13b8","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import os\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# URLs and file paths\nXML_URL = \"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/45um-c62r/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD\"\nOUTPUT_CSV = \"/work/Exports/brain injury data/tbi_data/tbi_data.csv\"\nDATA_FOLDER = \"/work/Exports/brain injury data/tbi_data\"\n\n# Checks for data directory\nos.makedirs(DATA_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Download the XML data\nresponse = requests.get(XML_URL)\nxml_path = os.path.join(DATA_FOLDER, \"tbi_data.xml\")\nwith open(xml_path, \"wb\") as file:\n    file.write(response.content)\nprint(f\"Downloaded XML data to {xml_path}\")\n\n# Parse the XML data\ntree = ET.parse(xml_path)\nroot = tree.getroot()\n\n# Extract data dynamically\ndata = []\nfor entry in root.findall(\".//row\"):  \n    record = {}\n    for field in entry:\n        tag = field.tag.split(\"}\")[-1]  \n        record[tag.lower()] = field.text \n    data.append(record)\n\n# Convert to DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Display detected column names\n# print(f\"Available columns in XML: {df.columns.tolist()}\")\n\n# **Map correct field names**\ncolumn_mapping = {\n    \"year\": \"year\",\n    \"ed_visits\": \"tbi_ed_rate\",\n    \"hospitalizations\": \"tbi_hospital_rate\",\n    \"deaths\": \"tbi_death_rate\"\n}\n\n# Filter only relevant columns and rename them\ndf = df[list(column_mapping.keys())].rename(columns=column_mapping)\n\n# Convert numeric values\nfor col in [\"tbi_ed_rate\", \"tbi_hospital_rate\", \"tbi_death_rate\"]:\n    df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col], errors=\"coerce\")  # Convert to float, set errors as NaN\n\n# Save to CSV\ndf.to_csv(OUTPUT_CSV, index=False)\nprint(f\"Data extraction complete!
