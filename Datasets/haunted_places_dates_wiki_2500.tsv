Ada	United States	"Ada witch - Sometimes you can see a misty blue figure floating within a 3-mile radius of the Ada Cemetery on 2 Mile between Egypt Valley and Honey Creek. The story of her origin is as follows: A man suspected his wife of having an affair, so he followed her late one night when she thought he was asleep. Sure enough, she went to a field near their property where she met her lover. The husband was enraged and killed his wife, which resulted in a struggle with the other man. Both men died from their injuries. It is said that late at night (especially during the night of and the nights preceding a full moon) people driving by the field can see her ghost, searching for her lover. Some people have reported stopping to try to communicate with her, but she always disappears or runs into the woods where she cannot be followed (due to the thick brambles that inhabit the area). She is said to dress in a long white gown which authorities say dates her to the turn of the 20th century. Usually she is seen alone, but sometimes witnesses report seeing a ghostly death scene re-enacted... Others report seeing nothing at all but hearing the killer's shouts of rage followed by the victims' screams of agony... Although it is said she haunts the field on Honeycreek Road where she died, other witnesses have reported her in nearby Seidman Park, and in nearby Findlay Cemetery, where she is supposedly buried. This story was actually featured in the book ""Ghosts of Grand Rapids."""	Ada Cemetery	Michigan	MI	-85.50489309999999	42.9621061	-85.4954803	42.960727	1888/02/24
Addison	United States	A little girl was killed suddenly while waiting for a school bus by a speeding car. Since her death things have happened. The day of her funeral she started knocking on doors of the house she was born in.1 month later as her clothes were to be removed the doors in the home flew open with no reason. Cold spots now can be felt & knocking at the door is still present to this day in the home. Also when there swings in the yard you could see them swing real high as if someone was swinging on them. lights like to go on & off in this home & she does move things to let someone know she is there. The cemetery where this child lies has had alot of activity also. When you visit her grave she has a twirly that will start going around & round with no reason or wind blowing to let you know she is present. Some have said she has been spotted walking the cemetery very restless as if she doesn't realize she has passed on.	North Adams Rd.	Michigan	MI	-84.3818434	41.9714248	-84.3471684	41.986434	2025/02/01
Adrian	United States	If you take Gorman Rd. west towards Sand Creek, you will come to a gravel road leading north. A mile or so up this road you will come to narrow one lane trestle bridge. The road goes under this. Legend has it that at one time there was a farm house built near the tracks. Late one night a fire broke out in the barn. While the father ran to the barn to try to get the horses out, his wife and young son went to the tracks to wave down one of the many trains that would use that right of way. They were too close to the tracks however and both were struck by the train as it went past. The father was killed in the barn. Now if you go out there late at night, you can sometimes communicate with the Father. He will not allow you to talk to his wife or son; as if he was protecting them . There are other people living in the area now, and a large streetlight has been placed there by the people who own the neighboring land. If you stay there to long, they will call the police. However if you make your visit short enough they will usually leave you to it. This place has also been described as a good place to go to contact other spirits. The Father can be asked to help in this matter. He will not allow antagonistic spirits to talk however; once again to protect his family.

Adrian	United States	In the 1970's, one room, room 211, in the old section of the dorms exhibited several phenomena. Don't know if this still continues today. The door into the room from the hallway, as well as the door into the bathroom, would open and shut on their own, the main door even if it had been locked. After closing, it would be locked again. There was also a spot on one wall (a wall that the room shared with a boarded up, no longer used laundry shaft) where two points of light would appear, shaped similar to eyes. Attempts were made to explain their appearance (they were visible any time it was dark in the room). They were screened off from the windows to see if they might be reflections, they weren't. When objects were placed between them and the windows they actually became brighter. We tried painting the walls, putting several coats of paint over them (thinking they may have been a joke of a previous resident, made with glow in the dark paint) - also having used sandpaper on the wall in that spot first before painting. They still appeared bright as ever after the painting. We tried covering them over by hanging a picture over them, but the picture kept falling down or moving. Last attempt to hang picture (it was a drawing on a piece of paper and simply taped to the wall) resulted in us waking up the next morning to find it taped to the ceiling over my bed. We finally moved a tall dresser in front of it and that seemed to take care of it. Reports from later residents told us that they had placed a mirror over it, and they had a rocker in the room. One night during a party, with several witnesses, the rocker began rocking on its own, then flew back and smashed the mirror. Have had no contact with the school since graduation, so don't know if these things still happen or not.

Algoma Township	United States	On a winding dirt road next to the Rogue River called Friske, there is a small turn-around for no particular reason. On this turn-around, there is a trail that leads off a ways into the woods. If you follow the trail, it leads to an old iron bridge called Hell's Bridge. It is said that if you are sitting or standing on the bridge at midnight you can hear the devil laughing. The reason is, in the 1800's, when Algoma didn't really exist and Rockford was known as Laphamville, a man named Elias Friske murdered several children and claimed a demon made him do it. Later the bodies were found in the part of the river where the bridge is now. Sometimes you can also hear the children crying, @r the noise of splashing water where their bodies were thrown. Some fishermen in the early morning have reported seeing a strange figure near the bridge...	Hell's Bridge	Michigan	MI			-85.62292959999999	43.1492928	1800/01/01

Ann Arbor	United States	Mercywood was a mental hospital before closing down. security guards heard the elevators moving when the building was empty. Sounds would come from the boiler room. In the basement were personal belongings of the inmates. There was also a bowling alley and bumper pool tables in the basement. There were insane rambling written on the walls in some of the rooms. Behind the hospital there was a convent where the nuns lived that worked in the hospital and even to go in there was a very uneasy feeling. It is like you can feel the insanity that surrounded the place. Also an evil feeling. They have since torn down the old hospital but something has been built there recently.

Central Lake	United States	The Lamplights Inn has been a landmark in Central Lake since 1924. It was built in the very early 1900s. Beginning in the early '50s, the successive owners have had persistent reports of ghosts. A man and woman dressed in late '20s - early '30s garb have been seen many times over the years, not only by owners' families, but also by employees and customers alike. The descriptions are uncannily similar. A customer recently reported the man and woman ghosts dancing together in the bar area with a little girl ghost looking on. These ghosts also window peep (on the second floor). They certainly appear to be fun loving. Another story tells of the daughter of a former hotel manager, who was preparing to elope with her fiancée, and tripped on her gown while descending the ladder. She fell to her death and returns to walk the hallway upstairs in her wedding gown. And, it is a fact that Mrs. Gill who, with her husband, were the first managers of the hotel, returned and lived out her remaining years at the hotel. She died in the early '50s in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Many people have reported seeing her stand in the upstairs window looking onto the village. In 1979 Ted Strzempek bought the lamplight he said he was in the upstairs hallway painting when a women in a white dress ran by him and through all the boxes he had stacked by the wall she ran into a bedroom and he ran in after her only to find an empty room. The Murphy's now own the lamplight and if you ask them if the lamplight is haunted they will not deny it.	Murphy's Lamplight Inn	Michigan	MI	-85.264923	45.0720901	-85.2645105	45.0700047	1924/01/01

In the process he broke several windows, trashed the place, slit his wrists and neck, and was found by the sales staff in the morning wrapped in a blanket talking to himself. He did not die but it was a very violent experience. 10 or so years ago a man was distressed over losing his parents and shot himself in the head overnight on top of his parent s grave. Several of the grounds crew have seen a man dematerialize in the same area a few times. This was in the summit hill garden which is the oldest garden in the cemetery. In the day or night there can be an overwhelming feeling of being watched. About 6 or 7 years ago there was a sales manager who quit after seeing an Indian in the sales office walk thru a wall. There is also a story not verified that a police officer shot a teenager on the grounds and the boy died and was buried there. In the months following the cop went mad and one night was caught wearing camouflage and face paint digging up the boy that he killed.

The builder, a gentleman named George D. Mason, was said to have gone broke financing the building, and having lost all his money (and his wife, who left him shortly after filing bankruptcy) became despondent & jumped off the roof to his death. Night watchmen have seen his transparent form at the bottom of the stairs that lead to the roof. Also, one of the roof doors will always be open, sometimes only moments after the watchman has locked it. Many other unusual sightings have occurred there, including unnatural cold spots and shadows moving in the third floor hallway behind the Drill Hall, various footsteps, the sound of doors slamming in locked, unoccupied rooms, and feelings of being ""watched"" or being ""unwanted"".

The story goes that one night a man and a girl were there and the girl wouldn't do anything with the guy so the guy kicked her out of the car and slammed the door. Her hair supposedly got caught in the door and it is said that he dragged her down the road several miles. If you go down the street that she was dragged on you can her a knocking on the side of your car many times as if she was caught on the side of your car. - February 2004 Correction: The road was never called ""Knock Knock"" but the story is true and it is in the archives of the Detroit news, dated June 12th 1962, the girl was a babysitter that got caught up in and taken by the man of the house and when she refused his advances he kicked her out of his car but it was her dress not her hair and she was dragged to her death."

Grosse Ile	United States	The story goes that a man was hung from a tree branch in the middle of the night. You can still see the branch where the man was hung from at the fork of the road. It has been said that if you go there in the middle of the night, noises are heard and you will have the feeling of not being wanted there. Feeling of being watched and followed. Noises and lights through the trees. Having to go away. Also, ny people report seeing a 10 -12 year old boy riding his bike while driving through the bird sanctuary at night. He appears to be wearing all beige or gray and is generally approached from behind. The rider clad in an outfit entirely made up of the same color is what seems to grab the immediate attention of most people who have related this story. Upon overtaking the rider, the passengers in the car invariably turn to have another look at this kid out for a ride on an unlit road in an area where people are not often found. All they report seeing behind them is empty road and dense woods stretching out before them.	Wildlife Sanctuary	Michigan	MI	-83.1484706	42.1647606	-83.1445904	42.1290753	2025/10/12

Harrison	United States	There are many stories about this house. One is the mother (Mrs. Reinke) was standing in her kitchen putting away groceries, and looked up and saw twin daughters (around 6 years old) holding hands and walking toward her. They walked right past her and out the door down towards Budd Lake. Another story is the large man story. Mr. Reinke was tying up his boat when he looked up into his bedroom window and saw a large figure of a man in the window. He rushed up to make sure everything was ok and when he got there, nothing was in the room. Soon after, another sighting of this large man happened. The daughter was sleeping when she noticed that a light was coming from her closet. The way the light comes through the window it would be impossible to be shining into the closet. She looked away, and when she looked back, saw a large man in her closet, the same man her dad had seen earlier. She described the man looking just the way her dad had seen, and he hadn't told anyone about the man yet (he didn't want to look stupid). The next day, the whole family was out of the house, and no one had been there all day. When the daughter came home, she found her room in total shambles, everything in the closet had been thrown around, and figurines and other possessions where seen lying on the ground. Another story has to do with the son. One night he could hear a bouncing ball in the attic above his room. He hears it about once every month or so, and if he gets annoyed with it, he tells the ghost or whatever is bouncing the ball to quit, and it usually does. He is very used to it, and it doesn't scare him anymore to hear it. All of the son's friends are afraid to sleep in the house, and will not really sleep in any rooms alone.

Kent County	United States	Oakwood Cemetary - Oakwood stands on the corner of Cannonsburg and Brewer roads. Just west of Oakwood, until recently, stood the old Brewer family estate. Just west of that is a long lay of Grand River Valley land that once was the lumbertown of Austerlitz. There is much forgotton and paved-over history there. In the 1980's motorists returning home from Grand Rapids at night told of a woman who stood on the corner of Brewer and Cannonsburg roads she wore no coat, though the weather at the times during which she appeared was always disagreable. She was seen in cold rains and wet snows. This rural area just at the edge of town was not completely desolate so there are no stories of motorists stopping to offer the apparition a ride. As the stories go, she never thumbed or indicated in any way that that she was in distress, she just stood there enduring the elements. Could she have been a live person? Doubtfull, Homes were far enough away from Oakwood that there would have been no reason for a young woman to stand out on that corner late at night in nasty weath with no coat.

Lambertville	United States	Verna Drive - Update: The following reported haunting is a hoax.- The Monroe County Paranormal Society have just investigated this claim and their contacts in the sheriff's department tell them that there has never been such a murder in the entire county, let alone in the quiet of Bedford Township. Also Lambert Estates also has never existed. One also has to wonder how such a horrific tragedy as the game show story never even made it to the local news. - Off Monroe Road in Lambertville, Michigan, there is a subdivision called Lambert Estates. Lambert Estates is mostly made up of a road called Verna Drive. The subdivision was formed in 1957. In the early summer of 1978, Steven Madison, a 33-year-old worker for a glass plant in Toledo, Ohio, walked into a home on Verna Drive and killed an elderly couple with a hammer found in the garage. He then moved into several other houses that night, and killed 7 others. 3 male adults, 1 female adult, 2 male children, and 2 female children. He used a block of firewood to kill a family of 3, a wood saw to kill a young college graduate, and smothered or strangled the other 3. He then went into the woods next to the neighborhood and hung himself from a maple tree. Reports of screams often come from two houses in the neighborhood. In the early July's, residents report a figure of a man walking down the street carrying a piece of firewood wearing a green shirt and jeans that appear to be blood stained. A neighbor once approached the man after seeing him 3 consecutive nights. When the man was asked who he was, he turned and faced the resident with a frightening wide grin and wide eyes. He walked off after not responding and disappeared in the front yard of an residents house. He was also reported seen in the woods, hanging from a tree, when the owner of the woods walked in one evening while walking his dog. He noticed nothing out of the ordinary at first, until when standing under a tree; drops of water fell on him. He looked up and saw him hanging by his neck as if he just died. The water was apparently tears that the man shed. An investigation was conducted to investigate the level of paranormal activity. The investigation was part of a game show where a group of people spent a week in the now abandoned neighborhood, to determine whether it was haunted. By the end of the week, a member of the investigating team disappeared and had not been found until two months later. He was found nearly dead in the glass plant in Toledo wear Steven Madison was employed. To this day the neighborhood remains empty, yet still stands. - June 2008 Update - The first posting for Lambert estates indicates it is abandoned. The update then states that the neighborhood never existed. Actually, not only has it existed, it remains very much occupied to this day. Every house is very well maintained. However, it is not in Temperance, it is in Lambertville, the next town over.	formerly listed in Temperance	Michigan	MI	-83.62601099999999	41.75810800000001	-83.624201	41.75290880000001	2008/06/01

Marine City	United States	"Once in a great while employees of the kitchen claim that machines will turn on when no one is around, such as mixers, dishwasher, etc. The very rare occasions have pretty much stopped but just recently in the summer of 2003 a radio/C.D. player boombox was said to ""have a mind of it's own"". It started with the volume increasing by it's self over the corse of 5-10 minutes to the point where it was full blast and had to be turned down. But a little while later it would turn it's self up again, blaring loud and causing frusteration among employees. One Sunday morning during a busy breakfast rush, a frusterated employee turned the power button off since it wouldn't stay at a reasonable volume level. Minutes later the radio suddenly turned on loud as can be. The red-faced employee turned it off again, and five minutes later the words ""sugar, sugar, oh honey, honey!"" came blaring out of the speakers (the radio station was placed at 104.3, oldies station). The employee grabbed the radio, unplugged it and sat it underneath a table. This ended the incents for that day and the night crew workers claimed they had no problems with the radio at all after they plugged it in that same night. All week the radio was fine until Sunday morning came. The breakfast buffet near the dining room was getting busy and kitchen workers became busy as well. The radio started turning it's self up again. The same employee from last Sunday battled it for 2 hours having to turn the volume down every 10-15 minutes. Everyone thought it was broken or something. He eventually turned it off and became very frusterated. And about 20 minutes later, the song ""Edge Of Seventeen"" by Stevie Nicks suddenly blared from the radio. The employee stared at the radio shaking his head as workers yelled for him to turn it down. He gritted his teeth, unplugged it, and wrapped the cord around it. It remained silent and still for an hour until it suddenly ""hurled it's self towards him"" but missed him by a few inches and hit the floor. The radio was permanently shot and would not work after this incident. Other strange incidents involved objects disappearing (knives, utinsils, etc.) while employees were just using them seconds earlier. After searching the kitchen for them they would be neatly placed where the cooks had originally placed them. Also, the same employee that dealed with the radio incident claimed that vegetables such as squash, potatoes, etc. would be neatly placed on a cutting board but nobody needed them and would have to be put back. This also occured with other items. One time a 5-gallon jug of milk was found sitting on a table in the kitchen. After checking the milk machine it was full with milk. He asked around if anyone got the milk out. Puzzled, the waitresses said no. He placed the milk jug back in the walk in refrigerator. He began chopping up some vegetables when all of the sudden an entire shelf of pizza pans (about 15 inches wide and 30 inches high) fell spreading loud bobbling pizza pans all over the floor. Seconds later 3 metal hotel pans fell off a shelf causing a he racket. The frusterated employee walked out, but returned the next day for work. This was like the grand finale for the poltergeist, if it even was a poltergeist, because nothing has happened since for several months. These events started out of the blue and only lasted two weeks and then abruptly stopped. Even before they occured nothing unusual ever happened there for years."

He then locked the doors and shot his two children, then himself. Now at night in the parking lot, you can see a man and a little boy and girl walking out the door then vanish.

Mount Pleasant	United States	This building used to be one of the most used State Mental hospitals for the criminally insane. There they would house people that would range from serial killers to rapists, but no matter the crime they were there for good...And they deserved to be. This place was never fenced in, didn't have electrical locking doors, and even let their patients wander freely on the grounds. Consequently many escaped. Nowadays the place is shut down. Too many people escaped and horrible things happened towards it's end. Such things like an orderly living in the houses provided for them just a few hundred feet away from the hospital was subject to the torture of one of the patients. She was raped and killed. Several of the escaped patients would harm civilians or stalk them....And finally the city of Mt. Pleasant closed down this hell hole. Hardly any information can be found on it now. It's really a very closed and touchy subject...but if you travers on the grounds, you'll find many disturbing things. Blood stains on the floors of the hospital, the yard for the children (eerie in and of itself becaue they housed children next to criminals)and even in broad daylight you can see and FEEL the presence of these spirits. There's a chain on the wall of one of the buildings that's completly sealed off....this is where they would chain like dogs the patients they didn't want wandering off more than the others...The place itself is imposing to visit let alone when the ghosts come out at night. Their moaning and wailing can be heard and their forms can be seen....(There are police that regularly patrol the grounds warding off college kids and protecting the other buildings on the property still running, but the state mental wards are closed)	Mt.

Northville	United States	In the old city of Northville in the 40's and 50's, were many insane asylums. They were not even a mile apart and ran through the whole town. They were all linked underneath the ground, for underground passages of very mentally ill patients and there's rumors that that's where many of the out of control patients were punished, not to alarm the others. The tunnels go all through the town, and under buildings, which are now on the place of the asylums. The tunnels are blocked off but the people who are brave enough to go in have experienced screaming, voices, moaning and orbs. Feelings of people behind you, crashes against the walls, and more. The tunnels are miles long and are tight compacted areas. There is a 200 dollar fine for anyone to go there, seeing as the late 80's and 90's brought many Satanists there trying to summon up spirits. -  Update: The buildings of the insane asylum have now been torn down and they are building a sub-division on the land. They had tried many times to get a company to come and build there and always something went wrong. They finally got some company to build expensive homes there and now there is a worry for the people who purchase their homes there. It is the whole block on the north-east corner of Sheldon and 5 mile roads.	Northville Tunnels	Michigan	MI			-83.4832692	42.4311464	0119/06/24

Romulus	United States	"Off Van Born near Wayne Rd there is a warehouse complex that originally started out as Stinson Aviation. They built planes there in the 1930's. On the floor of the area are the initials of the workers who called themselves the ""Left Wing Gang"". Ironically, some of the initials are the exact same as those of workers who are there today. Legend has it that a wing fell from one of the planes and killed several workers there. After that, it was expanded and Detroit Diesel occupied it for years, where it is said a man committed suicide there. That part of the complex is now used by Ford Motor Co as a warehouse. At any time during the day and night you can hear voices and sounds as if people are working with tools like they are building something. Many times, they call out to you by your name, leaving workers to answer back to no one! Carts move all by themselves, and several of the workers have had their clothes tugged on and have been tapped on the back, only to find they are alone in the area. You can hear someone enter the toilet stall next to you, only to find no one there. Several times, workers have approached strangers, thinking they were employees, only to see them disappear into the air! Even disbelievers agree that something is going on there.

St. Clair	United States	"It is said that in the fall of the year - near Halloween - that deep in the woods to the east of Pug Road, there will be a faint glow. And if one listens carefully, you can still hear the screams echoing down through the centuries. Before the settlement of Saint Clair County, there had been a French fur trader and his family who'd set up a trading post just off the ""big river"". He chose this location because of the canoe traffic on the river. They did well in their venture until one falls in the early 1700's. While the trapper trader was up north, Indians attacked the trading post, burning it to the ground, along with the trapper's wife and children. It has to be a quiet night, preferably with moon, and if you watch and listen closely."	Pug Road	Michigan	MI	-82.48739309999999	42.8546844	-82.486024	42.8208653	2025/01/01

Trenton	United States	A family called the Church family built the old hospital in the 1800s. It was their house until they died and their other family members didn't want anything to do with the house, so Henry Ford bought the old house and turned it into a hospital in 1944. The kids included in the family were two boys and a 9-year-old girl. The 9-year old girl loved horses so they had five horses. So, in that case, there are horse stables in the back. The little girl loved her horse and rode it everyday. Until one day, the little girl fell off the horse and broke her arm. The dad got mad and thought it was the horse's fault that his little girl broke her arm. So while she was at school one day, her dad killed the horse for hurting his little girl. The dad and his friend buried the horse on the side of their house. If you go to the side of the house where the dad and his friend buried the horse, there will be a little hill where the horse is. When the little girl came home and found out what her dad did, everyday from then on, she would come home from school, lock hers in her room, put her rocking chair in front of her window and she would sing to herself. Well, when the family died and Henry Ford bought the house, that was then the hospital, there was an old man that was in the hospital and his hospital room was what used to be the little girl's bedroom. While he was lying there in his bed, he heard singing, then he heard footsteps. When he got out of the hospital, he had someone set up thermal cameras in the room he was in and sure enough, they saw a figure in front of the window. After Henry Ford bought the hospital, six doctors wanted to build a bigger one and that's how the newer Riverside Hospital came about. They ended up closing down the old hospital 5 years ago because they found black mold growing in the building, which can kill you. They closed down the newer hospital one year ago because it was too much to keep up. Also, the Henry Ford company wanted to move everything to Wyandotte so Riverside lost business. There is a stack by the hospital. In a little tunnel thing outside of the new hospital, there is a furnace type thing. That's where they burned the amputated body parts of people. Also in that little tunnel, is the old morgue. THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SEEN IN THE WINDOW THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOVE. SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE DRESS WITH BROWN CURLY HAIR AND BOWS IN HER HAIR.

Walled Lake	United States	The shoe tree (previously mentioned in Salem) was on Thirteen Mile Rd. in Novi a quarter mile from Walled Lake, and from the site of the old Walled Lake amusement park. A child killer (the infamous Walled Lake Child Killer) kidnapped the children from the park, and buried their bodies in the nearby field around the tree. He threw their shoes into the tree. When the many dangling shoes were investigated, the bodies were found (but, the killer never was). If you went to the field at night, you could see and hear the clumps of tall grass moving around you, and you could hear the children cry for their mothers! Witnesses report very distinct, audible cries. The cries were not distant but, from just a few feet away. As you walked to where the cries came from, they seemed to move around. Not moving farther away, just around, sometimes back to where you were just standing. Just walking by the field would make your hair stand on end. The land was developed within the past couple of years. A subdivision now stands on this land. But, the field was on the south side of Thirteen Mile Rd., between Meadowbrook Rd., and Decker. The amusement park was later closed down. Not because of the murders but, because it rested on an old Indian burial ground (many in the area). It was where Novi Rd., 13 Mile Rd., and Southlake Dr. all meet, right on the lake.	Shoe Tree	Michigan	MI	-83.9703462	42.17038489999999	-83.4810481	42.537811	0124/02/24

Altoona	United States	"Beulah Road -  This legend is a cross between the spectral hitchhiker stories you have heard before and the sort of ""Resurrection Mary"" type tales familiar to the Chicago area. the ghost of the white lady still walks at night. For historical background there used to be a hotel at the top of the Wopsononock Mountain that was a fairly common getaway for people in Altoona. The Wopsononock hotel and famous lookout burned in the early part of the 20th century and was never rebuilt. In fact, at one time it was serviced by a narrow gauge railroad know as the ""Alley Popper"" although that has nothing to do with this tale. The road heading up to the Wopsy Lookout (as it is known hereabouts) is now Juniata Gap road in Altoona. This road is a treacherous one bearing a curve known as the ""Devil's Elbow"" which has been the scene of many accidents. Apparently in the early part of the century a couple was married and was heading to the hotel at the lookout for their honeymoon. I know nothing of the father chasing them which is related to the Ebensburg tale you have given. The legend goes that they were both from Altoona and were heading up the road leading to the hotel when the carriage went over the edge rounding the Devil's Elbow. Both were apparently killed but the body of the husband was never recovered. Since then travelers on this road have encountered the specter of a woman in white, sometimes seen to be carrying a candle, who apparently is looking for something. Variations on the tale have her waylaying young men and looking them over to see if they are her husband, or hitching rides with young men headed for the top of the mountain and then disappearing near the Devil's Elbow. Apparently this spirit has also been seen on the road leading up the mountain where the lookout can be accessed from the other direction, Buckhorn Mountain, and she is also known as the ""White Lady of the Buckhorn"" as well as the ""White Lady of Wopsononock"". The site of the old hotel now is littered with television and radio towers and is still a sort of ""lover's lane"" spot for a lot of folks. Apparently some of the technicians at the towers have reported seeing her, but the most recent account (late 1990's) involved a man who offered her a ride. She apparently got into the car and he could not see her in the rear view mirror but could see her when he turned around. She said nothing to him and disappeared at the Devil's Elbow. Much like Resurrection Mary, it is a difficult tale to dispute since it has occurred so often to so many people over such a long stretch of time. Although the historical details are sketchy! No one knows who she was or when the accident actually took place. If you ever get a chance to get to this area take a trip on either road and you may get a chance to run into her."

The bride died from a broken neck and the groom was pinned under a horse (who had become lame) and slowly died next to his new bride. It is said by many locals that on very dark nights a fog creeps up onto the road (which is more of a dirt lane) and you can hear a horse drawn buggy fast approaching behind you, but before it comes upon you there is a crash, a scream, then all is silent and the fog vanishes.

One year, a haunted tour was given, with real and fake stories told along the route. As the tour was given, a friend was instructed to go ahead and turn off the basement lights for a walk through Comenius Hall. This was to give a more spooky affect. Three times he tried the lights and all three times, he watched the switch turn back on. After that, he abandoned the task and went back to the group. As the group descended to walk through the basement, one of the members of the group hesitated. He was blind and his guide dog was leading him. According to the man, the dog was signaling danger and trying to stop him from venturing into the basement. There was no visible danger, yet the dog was very reluctant and tried diligently to stop them from going to the basement. After the tour, the man explained that his dog never did that before and was unsure what such a reaction was caused by. No one on the tour noticed anything suspicious in the basement.

Butler County	United States	The old Mill turned state park is home to many spirits who still roam the hills and Slippery Rock Creek.

Some nights if you park your car right above the mill the man can be seen walking down the hill to mill. He goes into the mill a light seems to be on and screams are heard coming from the mill. There is also the spirit of a caretaker that lived on the property from the early 1930's until his death around 1960. Times he can be seen chasing people away from the land he loved and took care of. Legend has it that a girl died in auto accident on the covered bridge that crosses Slippery Rock Creek beside the mill. Stories say she can be summoned by parking your car in the middle of the bridge turning off the engine and lights and honking your horn 3 times. She is supposed to appear in your rear view mirror. Natural human reaction is to turn around and look but she's never there and disappears from the mirror.

Carbon County	United States	Jim Thorpe - The old Carbon County Prison was last used in 1995. There have been numerous reports of unexplained phenomena at the prison in recent years. The most famous ghost story associated with the prison is the hand print left in a cell by a man wrongfully accused of being a member of the Molly Maguires. The Molly Maguires were a group of disgruntled miners in the 1870's who used violence as a means to bring about change in the corrupt mining industry. Several men were accused, arrested, and eventually hanged at the prison for being Molly Maguires. On the eve of his execution, a man who proclaimed his innocence ran his hand along the dirty floor of his cell and made an impression of his hand on the wall, claiming the impression would always remain as proof of his innocence. The next day, he was hung and the hand print was washed away. Three days later, the print reappeared. As legend has it, the wall has been repeatedly washed and painted, but the hand print always returns. The wall was supposedly even ripped down and re-plastered, but the hand print returned yet again. The prison is now opened to tourist, but the cell with the hand print is off limits. Visitors can still view the print through the cell door, though.	old Carbon County Prison	Pennsylvania	PA	-75.78172529999999	40.8775327	-75.667356	40.901975	1995/01/01

Drexel Hill	United States	"Originally the old Drexel Estate and then later before the school an orphanage- there are 2 tales here. The 1st is the story of an orphan that was murdered by another. On the second floor of the school there are still 2 halls left with the original bedrooms- still not converted to classrooms. The halls are on the same floor as the chapel. Students have claimed to see furniture move in those rooms. There is 1 old rocking horse in particular that will ALWAYS MOVE ON ITS OWN when the room is occupied for too long. Because of the hostile vibe felt in that room, people believe that is the spirit of the murdering orphan, who also died there due to a ""freak"" accident. There are also reports of students seeing two children late at night, running, fighting, and screaming through those halls. The 2nd story is the tale of a nun who taught at the orphanage. She hung herself in the bell tower and haunts it to this day. Many times the bell will ring unexpectedly and late at night a light will go on and off. Unlike the modern light that is suppose to be up there (which seems to always mysteriously short out), it looks like a candle. Students who have tried to get up there have been spooked severely. The school has had the bell tower sealed off for years. Some students have reported coming back from school dances and looking up to see the nun looking at them from the bell tower."

Many times late at night you can see them walking the grounds. They are very restless and some quite hostile.

Duncannon	United States	"Amity Hall Hotel - Amity Hall - There was a young woman found stabbed to death laying on the front porch on a couch. The legend has it that there was a family that lived in it and the husband went crazy and killed his wife, then his kids, then himself in the upstairs hallways/rooms of the hotel. IN the days of the PA Canal system, canal travelers used to stay there, then in the civil war days it was used as a hospital. - IF planning to visit this place – try to get permission - it says no trespassing When you get permission bring plenty of batteries, because they drain quickly. In the corner of the L-shaped building, very small bluish lights have been. The creepier place on the outside is a door at the end of a hall which is locked shut. The worst room in the house is upstairs, the trophy room. This room is filled with a giant feeling of ""GET OUT OF HERE"". The glass and mirrors are all broken. Very faint white figure of what appears to be a woman in the attic window facing the parking lot can be seen. white flashes of light in the attic windows facing the road have been seen. Faint glows fading in and out of the windows, as well as small but somewhat bright points of light coming from the corner of the L-shape. Frightening black figures, not the shape of a dog, but about the size of a dog, linger in the parking lot. (I believe they are called imps) A particularly vengeful spirit has sat outside of cars in which males are present. It’s believed it is the wife whom the husband beat to death and left on the front porch. It is also said that you can experience reenactments of the murder right in front of you."

Erie	United States	The Erie cemetery is said to be haunted. There are a few locations that are definitely eerie. The first one is a mausoleum. It's blackened, like it was burned. There's no name on it, but you can tell that there used to be one. It also has a lot of vampire like designs on it. The other area is called the Witches Circle. It is a group of tombstones that are in the shape of a circle. Some of them are burnt black. Legend has it that Satan came to get his loyal followers. The burns are supposed to be from the fires of Hell. It has been tried repeatedly to get the scorch marks off of the tombstones, but it doesn't ever come off. I've inspected these stones myself and tried to read what they said on them. One had some pretty weird stuff on it. You get chills and hear walking behind you while at this cemetery. When you turn around, though, no one is there. Witnesses have seen a big black dog there and when they looked again, it wasn't there.

Erie	United States	Frat House  - Years ago at this frat house there was a Halloween costume party the fraternity was hosting. Everybody was dressed up in a costume. During the party, what appeared to be a person, was looming around quietly dressed in a dark cowboy-like outfit with a big brim black hat. One of the people at the party noticed the figure and followed it to a room upstairs. Then the figure turned around and looked at the person and disappeared. Later on during the party, noises such as walking, banging, and windows opening and closing began to be heard from the upstairs of the house. Some of the people at the party went upstairs to see what was happening. When they got up there, the figure was seen again and this time it spoke. It yelled at them to GET OUT! Then it vanished and everybody left the house. To this day, it is not known if the figure still haunts the house.

Erie	United States	This structure used to be a convent in the earlier part of the twentieth century. A woman that had been told that her lover was killed in WW2 joined the convent back in its day. A few years later, the lost lover returned, but the nun had already given her heart to God. She went crazy and was locked in the tower where she committed suicide. The ring that her lover gave her was placed at the base of a Virgin Mary statue. For the last fifty years, anyone who had touched the ring died within five years. The ring was eventually locked away, but appears every so often. People have also claimed to see the nun's spirit roam the halls.

The lights have dimmed out in the bedroom where the doctor died, while the lights in the hallway have stayed lit, and they're both on the same circuit. Sounds of things being thrown around in the basement in the dark, but the noise stops when the lights are turned on, and nothing is out of place. Once during a storm over a break, one of two people in the house heard the front door slam open, they went downstairs, closed the door, only to turn around and see wet footsteps on the carpet. Noises of walking upstairs were then heard. The person raced upstairs to find more wet footprints. The person chased the noised and footprints through the house. As the person chased the noised through the only hallway on the 3rd floor, when the other person was studying in the hallway, the studying person said that nobody had passed by, yet they both then heard the noises going down the stairs. They then heard the front door slam open again, and the footprints had exited the house. Another person was closing one of the heavy doors late one night when in mid swing, the door suddenly stopped dead, as if it had hit a solid obstacle. There was no obstruction, and the door could not have caught on anything. They swung the door again, and it then swung freely.

Greensburg	United States	The Courthouse Square office building is built on the site of the old county jail, which was in use from the early 1900's to the 1960's. In the early 1900's the building was the location of several executions by hanging. In 1984, 911 dispatchers in what was then the 911 dispatch center saw the transparent image of the lower part of a man hanging on a video security monitor. The camera was pointing toward the hallway in the upper parking level, leading from the magistrate's office toward the delivery garage area. When they went to the area to investigate the image on the security monitor, they saw nothing; however, they felt coldness in the area, and were seen to pass through the image on the camera as they checked the area. Later research in the historical society revealed that the hangings were conducted on the second floor on the prison building, which would locate it in the area now known as upper parking in the new building, in that part of the office building near the intersection of Pittsburgh St. and Pennsylvania Ave.	County Courthouse Square Bldg.

The female student began haunting the costume shop of the old theatre and is rumored to have moved to the new auditorium when it was built, in one of the costumes. Numerous sightings of her have been reported and various strange and unexplainable occurrences have happened that are attributed to her.

Harrisburg	United States	Harrisburg State Hospital was an insane asylum for over 150 years. It admitted its first patient in 1851 as The Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital. It is located on the outskirts of city limits of Harrisburg on a 200 acre plot, most of which falls within Susquehanna Township lines. There is an entrance on Cameron St. across from the Farm Show complex and another one off of Elmerton Ave. A hiking and biking trail called the Capital Area Green Belt leads into another entrance in the Edgemont area of the city. It closed its doors as an asylum in 2006, but the grounds and buildings are still in use today as offices for several state agencies such as the PA Office of Mental Health. There are now over 50 buildings on the grounds, although a large portion of the land is still Woodland. Many different noises from screams to footsteps are heard and many different visuals ranging from shadows to full-bodied apparitions are witnessed. The morgue, although very tiny, is 2 stories tall and the basement leads into the tunnels. There are large blood-like stains on the floor and all the exam tables are still there. There is also poltergeist activity reported in the various buildings. Be warned, it may be illegal to be on the property at night and there are some security guards. The morgue, stables, and some of the tunnel entrances are secluded enough to probably not be noticed if entered at night, and since that area is right by the Green Belt, one could enter the property from that entrance and have the car readily available, but it is probably best to try and get permission. It is DEFINITELY illegal to actually be in the tunnels or the morgue, as well as any other buildings that are boarded up or locked.

Lebanon County	United States	Hotel Road - In the current state game lands just North West of Indiantown Gap, by Hawk Watch Mnt. Used to be the site of a summer hotel for the rich in the early 1800's.  Through its years it didn't make much money, the owners closed down the hotel for it to later be bought and remade into a boyscout camp.  The hotel suffered a horrifying fire and the majority of the residents inside of it burned to death.  Just up the hill from the hotel is an old abandoned railroad bed.  Along this railroad bed, from the 1600's to late 1800's early 1900's, sat a multitude of mine towns.  One such mine town, about 3 miles from the hotel, was named Raush Gap.  It had a population of about 1,000 people.  This mine town house a family who's only job was to switch the tracks for the trains.  The man in the house fell ill and died, and during a time of morning his wife forgot to switch the tracks.  This lead to a horrific train accident killing upwards of 250 people.  When the wreck was all cleaned up and the bodies buried in a, yet undiscovered because its hidden in the woods behind the current standing cemetery, mass grave.  The towns people turned on the woman for not doing her job and were on their way to lynch the woman.  To their dismay they did not find her, at least not alive, the woman had thrown herself in front of a moving train killing her instantly.  To this day the part of the tracks where the wreck happened you get a heavy feeling of pain on your chest, it is hard to breath, it is always about 20 - 30 degrees cooler than anywhere else.  You can hear the train whistle, and it is stated that you will see a figure of a woman holding a lantern, the lady with the lantern, roaming the tracks, seemingly looking for the train she once lost.  And if she sees you she will rush towards you and if she passes through you, you will die in a car accident that will look like you were hit by a train.

The cemetery at this church is said to be haunted by the Blue-Eyed Six, a gang that murdered a local man and whose members were all subsequently hung in the cemetery as punishment(a play has been written about this event and was possibly copyrighted). This information is NOT TRUE. The Blue Eyed Six were never related in any way to the church or it's cemetery. Although all these things occured within this area more or less. They never were hung in the cemetery or buried there, nor is it believed they would have any reason to haunt this place as they have no worldy connections. The Blue eyed six were all caught and tried in the Lebanon County Court House, hung in thecourtyard of the Lebanon County prison except Josiah Hummel who died in Prison, and all were buried seperatly on their individual homesteads.

Each time they encountered this boy he appeared whole to them, just like a normal human being. there wasn't anything else about the boy's appearance that was odd or out of the ordinary. when workers encountered the boy, he would look directly at them then run from them and attempt to hide elsewhere in the kitchen.

Livermore	United States	"Reports of a phantom house, that disappears. From legend and research the place was a town in the 1800's. There was a witch living amongst the people and they burned her alive, as she died she placed a curse of flood on the place and death on the people. On the anniversary of her death there was indeed a great flood, burying the entire town and people in it alive. if you park your car near the gates at night, a train going across the only way out, blocking you in for an hours worth of demon faces in your windows, howling screeching sounds, corpses trying to get at you, and the like. (Remember, in actuality the corpses are still underwater in the town, never recovered). You can actually walk thru this place (beware, there are wild dog packs throughout) and good luck not getting lost. If the waters low enough, you can see the tops of chimneys and houses during the day. Pay close attention to what you hear; sounds even in the daytime are unexplainable and for added fun, try the cemetery off to the left for gravesites of those who died before the flood. Not recommended for ANY child, the place is dangerous. And don't drive thru there, you will get fined at least $500.For more information check out the Westmoreland Historical Association, and look up Livermore. It's all there in black and white. And yes, the ""Livermore Cemetery"" sign is the original that was used in the black and white version of Night of the Living Dead."	Satan’s Seat	Pennsylvania	PA			-79.3330933	40.4617342	1800/01/01

Manor	United States	"The Norwin Elks used to be the old Fletcher's place. He made jellies and such assortments as that. When it closed down is when all the hauntings were noticed. . . There are 3 distinct hauntings. The first haunting is in the Old Fletcher Barn (Which became the Terror Barn). One of the groundskeepers apparently had nowhere to go when Fletcher's was shutdown, so he thought he'd make a statement to the world by hanging himself in the barn facing the window on the second floor. Working there I noticed the scariest things imaginable would happen. For one thing (and they had this on tape one night while we were making a commercial for the terror barn) the radio (which was located at the other side of the barn in the ""Michael Meyer's Room"") was changing stations rapid ply and shutting off and turning on while we are all meeting in the wizard room (on the other side of the barn, nowhere near Michael Meyers).The second thing, if you lay on the torture rack and look up you can see a man who walks the rafters above. The other thing has to do withhe sound of cowboy boots following you as you walk around. The last thing is above all the scariest, a piercing scream while we were closing one night. The second haunting of the Norwin Elks is located in the bar/dining area. Apparently in the attic there is a specter who you cannot make out, but she/he is there and watches you. Some say that it is a little girl and others say it's a little boy. The third haunting is in the basement of the Norwin Elks. If you walk down there you can hear a dog barking for hours on end, but the Norwin Elks don't have any dogs. And sometimes you see a maintenance man down there who tells you that the pipes of the furnace need a cleaning, and when you ask them what's wrong he vanishes. There are other reports of a man in the bar who never leaves and when you finally force him outside he vanishes after he leaves the door. But no one can say for certain what happened to any of these ghosts. The only ghost that we know for sure is the Fletcher's Groundskeeper in the terror barn who hung himself."

Mars	United States	"At the turn of the 20th Century, when the station was still fairly new, a small cat lingered in the rooms where its owner worked. It was somewhat of a mascot for the station over the next couple of years. One day, it mysteriously disappeared. When the station was moved in August of 2000, workers found a preserved body of a dead cat in the foundation. After the station was moved, members of the Mars Historical Society began experiencing strange happenings in the old structure. Cat sounds can be heard. What is even more disturbing is that during the restoration work, members discovered paw prints of a cat in the sawdust of a newly cut board. Some members have even reported seeing a small cat wondering around in the rooms. The members have nicknamed the ghost cat, ""Chessie"". It was named after the now retired Chessie System. It is said that Chessie's spirit emerges out of the ground where the station used to be. It runs across the CSX tracks and enters the station where it now sits. Many believe that Chessie searches unsuccessfully for it’s lovable master who is now long gone."	Mars Railroad Station	Pennsylvania	PA	-80.00843080000001	40.694696	-80.0117254	40.6958996	2000/01/01

Meadville	United States	Brooks Hall - One of the rooms on the third floor in the all female dorm is supposedly haunted. First of all, Pennsylvania does not allow sorority houses on campus because of an outdated law to do with houses of ill repute. So sorority sisters were housed in the all female dormitory, Brooks Hall. The Greeks on campus had a ritual for pinning a girl that involved the pinner to walk down Main St. with his brothers behind him with torches. They would walk down Brooks Walk, a very long, red-brick lane that led right to the front of Brooks Hall. The pinner would climb the building to the front terrace where the pinnee would be waiting with her sorority sisters to be pinned. Well one such time the fraternity brother was climbing up the front of the building and fell to his death. The sister, terribly distraught, went to her room and in a fit of hysteria jumped out of the window, killing herself. Her spirit supposedly haunts her old room and furniture has been moved around, pictures fall from the walls, the window opens and the current tenants all are driven to request a housing reassignment.

Middletown / Lima	United States	"This county home was established in Media, Pennsylvania in 1807, where it remained until 1857. It then moved to its present location in Lima on the 210-acre Abraham Pennell Farm on Middletown Road. The farm was called ""Fair Acres"", and as a county facility it retained this name. During the early years in Lima, the County facility often cared for entire families as well as individuals in a self-contained environment. A part of this facility was the operation of a farm used for the production of food items for people within the facility. The farming operation was discontinued in 1967 when the facility underwent a transition from a partially residential community to a health care facility and directed its emphasis to elderly residents of Delaware County who required medical and nursing care. With this change, ""farm"" was dropped from the name, and in 1978 the institution became the Fair Acres Geriatric Center. The Center now consists of eighteen buildings located on a 210-acre tract in Lima, Pennsylvania. Five of these are resident buildings, containing both skilled and intermediate care nursing units with total accommodations for over 900 residents.  One building in particular, Building 4, now has many separate offices and a main hallway shared by each office.  This building was originally a big, single room that held hundreds of hospital beds in rows in the late 1800's. An elderly woman with long gray, straight hair and wearing a hospital gown has been seen walking in the hallways.  She has been seen by about 5 different people in different years.

Milton	United States	A former worker reports weird things would happen periodically. Mostly though, you would get the feeling that someone was walking behind you or watching over your shoulder. Also, some parts of the library will be really warm, but when you go into an older section, you will be freezing cold. Also, computer problems happened where they wouldn't work one minute, but the next time you try it, it does. The strangest experience they had was when they were in the basement where they forgot their sweater and no one else was there, because it was after hours. They where down in the basement and they heard footsteps up above me where the juvenile and some of the adult books are. When they went back upstairs, they checked everywhere just to make sure that the boss hadn't come in for something that she for got or something like that, but no one was there. They are still a little weary of being in the library at night now when no one else is there. They talked to the boss and coworkers about this and they said that they have felt something like what was described also, and told the submitter that supposedly one of the old librarians that worked there a long time ago died fairly young in age and still checks on things.

Montrose	United States	The site of the Inn has a long history. The original Inn was used as the first jail, as a funeral home before there was a funeral home in town and as a school room. The original building burned to the ground in the mid 1920's. When the new building was about 90 percent completed it burned to the ground again. The building that stands on the site now, was completed around 1926. Upstairs in the Inn there is a little boy that roams the hall and plays trick at all times of the day and night. He seems to like room #5 the most. More than one guest reported someone knocking on the door and no one being there when the door was opened. One guest in particular complained in the morning about the child that was staying in the Inn. He had upset here during the night with knocking on the door several times during the evening and giggling. There were no other guest in the Inn that night. The shade would be taken off the window and placed neatly on the pillow. The window was about 7 feet away from the bed. The time on the clock would be changed. The arm that was set the night before would not go off ( the alarm clock was changed in that room more than once due to the complaints concerning the alarm not going off). Room doors would open then slowly close. The child was reported as seen only once. He was crouched down with his face toward the corner with his hands over his eyes and he was giggling as though he was playing hide and seek. Downstairs in the Inn is a man that has been seen on many occasions and felt many more. This man was seen walking past the front office into the coat closet on one occasion. He seemed so real that the customer in the dinning room thought that he was about to steal a coat. The customer kept his eye on the closet until he realized that no one was coming back out so he leaned back in his chair where he could see into the closet and realized that no one was there. Employees reported him walking out toward the tavern area when the dinning and tavern area were closed and all the doors were locked. Customers have felt him walk behind them as they are checking out. The back dinning room has had objects thrown across the room (this usually happens during the equinoxes)	The Montrose House	Pennsylvania	PA	-75.8793981	41.8321015	-75.8771388	41.8339653	1926/01/01

The energy's also seem to not be concentrated in just one place, and move freely around the building. Wide majorities of people have reported experiences while living there. A student radio show around Halloween did a segment about the building, and it had several call-ins about strange occurrences at ""Agony #7"" (a student nickname given to the building).

Villanova	United States	"St. Mary’s Hall - St. Mary's Hall used to be a convent. Rumors of a nun that hung herself. Today St. Mary's is believed to be haunted by both students and night shift custodial workers. One nighttime janitor claimed to have heard a radio blaring from behind a closed door, and upon entering the vacant room, the music stopped and the janitor discovered the radio was unplugged! Several janitors also have reported hearing what sounds like water splashing from someone swimming in the St. Mary's pool at all hours of the night. However, upon entering the poolroom, no one is present, and the water in the pool is still. This has happened on more than one occasion. As well as hearing a piano being played in the music room, and no one is there. security guards have also claimed to have heard banging on the walls and doors coming from the kitchen in St. Mary's Hall. The odd thing about all of these occurrences is that they took place during the university's ""off-season"", when students have left the campus for the semester and the dorms are unoccupied."

South Los Angeles	United States	There are reports of ghostly happenings in the stock rooms of this former Zody's. It is believed that a double murder/suicide took place somewhere in the upstairs stockroom. Apparently, a couple worked together for Zody's and the boyfriend caught his girlfriend in a compromising situation with another male employee. The enraged boyfriend located a box cutter and slashed the two to death. He then slashed his own wrists and carotid artery. After several reports from employees of unusual activity, Kmart headquarters in Michigan has admitted to hiring paranormal/paraphysical investigators to conduct investigations into the incident. The conclusion was that indeed the building was occupied by several spirits. The investigators concluded that four different spirits dwell throughout the building. The fourth has not been linked to any known incident that may have occurred and thus is unknown for its presence. Kmart has remained quiet on the findings of this investigation and resources revealed that employees of this store are not advised of this activity. Prior to changing over to Kmart, Zody's employees reported seeing a man walking about in the stockroom. A woman is also seen running and sometimes screams are heard. In one case, an overnight employee sustained a 7 inch laceration while working in the stockroom. Zody's management insisted that the incident was just an accident caused by falling boxes that were stacked too high, but resources close to the victim tell another tale. A paring knife mysteriously came across the room and cut the employee across the chest. No one was seen in the area. The victim survived his wounds, but obviously resigned from the company. Sightings and sounds have been reported throughout the years, but no one else has been physically attacked since.	Kmart #7625	California	CA	-95.9918797	41.2142955	-118.2914872	33.9891116	1990/02/24

Belchertown	United States	the state school used to be a mental institution that often had very unfair and cruel treatment to it's inhabitants. there’s an old story of how two people, who were not mentally retarded, but only had low intelligence, fell very deeply in love, but were kept away from each other because back then, it was considered to be wrong for people with mental disorders to marry or date or have children. they would sneak to each other in the night and leave love notes and whisper to each other through windows. it's said that during the night, you can see them run between their dormitories. there are many ghosts haunting the state schools, and up until a few years ago, 3 of the buildings were used as elementary schools. now only one remains open, and another building has been converted into a teen center with a skate park outside. at night, if you sneak into the skate park, you can see the ghosts out roaming between the buildings. even walking through that place in the daylight is enough to give you the shivers, windows will break, doors slam open and shut, you can hear screaming and crying and moaning near the men's sleeping quarters, and the tunnel system that runs below the state schools often has lights flickering on and off, although power to the buildings was cut off years ago. the swings on the playground will swing when no ones in them, and just walking near the place, gives you a very sick feeling.

The headstones have been removed & one large marker listing the names of the dead is located in the second half of the park. Often the park is covered by a mysterious fog patch that does not extend past the roads to the houses on all sides. The fog also does not cover the road that dissects the two halves of the park. Locals say that the fog is the combined anger of the dead at the removal of the headstones. The park has very few visitors per year. Records of this information was once located in the old Whittier museum record room.

Whittier	United States	large Building built in 1903. Once used as an old Citrus packinghouse in the early 1900's. Now housing a Antique Mall since 1979 with 4 floors inside. The former Owners and Staff as well as the dealers experienced strange happenings. Two the stories are that 2 citrus plant workers died tragically in the mall. One story is that a worker had locked himself accidentally in the old freezer room in the basement and passed away. Another is unknown how but a worker died from machinery falling onto him in the back of the bottom floor. Dark shadowy figures have been seen in closing time. The cleaning crew has quit after hours when a woman cleaner screamed from the bottom floor claiming she saw a black figure watching her. Electrical appliances have sounded off with no batteries inside. Pictures have fallen feet away from where they were hung. Saucers and objects for sell have rolled or flung off onto the floors. A empty space has got the most attention where stairs use to be, cold spots and sensitive customers have felt a presence there. Curiously young children who know nothing of the mall refuse sometimes to enter the basement where the freezer accident occurred. King Richards is history all around and the staff claims that they feel no threat from the strange occurrences. Sometimes you just feel like they want to be noticed or known. Oddly enough the happenings really become more active around October through the holiday season. Its hard to separate the occurrences said one worker. the Antique items that are brought in by dealers some time hold a past with them as well. But for the feeling of King Richards you see, to know the difference. No harm from these ghost's just a remembrance of Whittiers History.	King Richards Antique Center.

Gloucester	United States	"Dog Town - Hidden in the woods off of rte 127, is a road that enters Dog Town, so called because the early fishermen hid the ""village"" in the woods away from the shore line to avoid detection from enemies. Many men died at sea while fishing leaving their wives and children alone, so they would acquire dogs, once the shoreline was deemed safe they abandoned the ""village"" leaving the dogs behind, creating wild dog packs. There are reports of a begger woman who asks for money at the entrance and curses you if you don't relent. Also a man who was dragged out by police because he went insane looking for the gold pieces the woman hid in her cellar is said to be heard ranting and raving.

Talk of a woman named Esmeralda, who died in a chair in the house during the fire, comes back to haunt the children who participate in the theatrical productions. Her apparition is seen during every production by 1 or more participants in the plays, floating above the lighting on the stage with a red eye. She also has appeared to few students when they sit in the purple painted chair that she died in. Sometimes when one of actors/actresses sit in the chair before a performance, bad luck comes about to them during their performance. So next time you are there, watch out because she has her eye on you!!! - June 2005 Correction: The truth about Essie, as she's affectionately referred to here, is yes she did die in a fire here when the building was still known as French's Opera House. She is said to ""live"" in the fly loft, above the lighting instruments above the stage. There is a purple chair in the audience, on the right hand side near the stage. Flowers are placed there before performances...if the flowers are not in full bloom, she will mess around with the lights during the performances.

Salem	United States	Sometimes you can smell cigarette smoke over near the projector, but you can't smell it anywhere else. There is a room at the end of the hall which is very cold. You can see shadows moving fast out of the corner of your eye. One time there was a person reflected in the window, standing next to the projector, but no one was there. Someone had keys on a clip hanging from their pocket at hip level, and these keys somehow came unclipped, flipped around, and clipped on a wire, while this person was standing there. A little while later, they realized they were missing and after searching everywhere, found them hanging on this knee level wire. (There are at least 15 keys on this key ring, so you would have heard them if they fell off.) Another time the light upstairs was shut off, and the only way to get up there is if you have a key, someone with a key turned it back on, and then 5 minutes later when they went upstairs, the light was off again. The lights upstairs are always kept on.	Patriot Cinemas	Massachusetts	MA	-70.893118	42.522611	-70.8967155	42.51954	2025/02/15

Salem	United States	Mainstage Auditorium - The ghost of a little Boy named Tommy is said by theater professors and students to haunt the auditorium. Tommy is supposedly the ghost of a child that got into the area above the auditorium one night during the '60's. He fell through a spot in the ceiling and was found dead in the seats of the auditorium by a professor the next day. Tommy still haunts the area above the auditorium, which has long been sealed up and used for storage. He is mischievous for the most part, making noises, moving things, and causing unexplainable problems in the theater. Technicians working on tall ladders swear they can feel Tommy putting a pressure on their backs. They claim that it is Tommy trying to prevent any one else from falling. December 2003 correction:The actual story is this: It was in the '70's when it happened, and the boy that fell wasn't a child, he was a teenager.The boy that died was named Tommy. Tommy and few other kids had been drinking and they snuck into the auditorium. They were fooling around, jumping on seats, rolling around on the stage, etc. When the kids where getting ready to leave, but they couldn't find Tommy. They figured that he had left and so they left. The next morning my dad got a call saying that his friend Tommy had fallen through the ceiling of the auditorium. He had fallen head first onto the floor and died on impact.

Niles	United States	"A young woman who's last name was Lowerey was on her way to a wedding possibly her own. Riding in a horse drawn carriage near the way stop of Scott's Corners, (between Pleasanton and Sunol, CA. Area is now Highway 84/680) she was thrown from the carriage when the horses were spooked by the first of two oncoming horseless carriages (car). After she was thrown the 2nd car struck her. Miss Lowerey became the first person to ever be killed by an automobile in this area. Many have seen a woman in white by the cemetery and near by areas, accompanied with strange lights. - November update: A paranormal researcher found there's quite an extensive collection of newspaper clippings that was donated to the library by a journalist. The clippings go back to the turn of the 20th century, so they cover the period when the ""accident"" happened. According to the first journalist to report on the supposed haunting, about ten years after the date in the 1920's when the woman was popularly held to have died, there was no mention of anyone dying in an accident in the canyon, and county records of the time listed no account of the body of anyone who had supposedly died in Niles Canyon. There was, in the early 50's, a young man who dressed in a white sheet and jumped out in front of motorists near one of the bridges on Halloween. He scared someone so bad that they immediately drove to the nearest phone and called the police, who arrived in force (owing to the legend of the white witch) and drew guns on what they thought was the ghost. The young man was almost shot, though he was not arrested, but he had to be taken to a coffee shop where it took him until 2am to calm down sufficiently to go home. The supposed ""white witch of Niles"" actually follows the scenario of a common fake ghost story, that being the ""hitchhiking ghost"" story. The Niles ghost is most commonly said to hitchhike to one of the bridges in the area, where she disappears at the tollbooth. There is no cemetery that they know of in Sunol, which is at the top of Niles Canyon Rd. Similarly; there is no Morrison Canyon ghost. Morrison Canyon road is a primarily one-lane road that leads up to the 680 freeway. There's even a radar-testing facility up there somewhere, complete with life-size wire models of helicopters and planes, mostly upside down. Now, on the OTHER side of the coin, there ARE photographs of orbs in Mission San Jose's church and in the graveyard, though the investigator does not own them. The church, the cemetery and the grounds are VERY active."

South Attleboro	United States	"A great deal of strange occurrences happen at St. Stevens. There is a gravestone with the last name Dousette by the big iron cross that used to glow green. Scientists came into the graveyard to figure out why it glowed green, and could come up with any answer. They eventually turned the stone a little out of place and the stone turned red for several days, then stopped glowing. If you take the name apart, Dousette, you can make ""do you see it."" If you drive into St. Stephens graveyard, the first thing that you will see is a big iron cross (that looks creepy). Take a left and drive back towards the woods on a dark night. When you go over the small hill and are facing the woods, flash your lights twice. A strange man will sometimes come out and tell you how to find spirits.

The main house is believed to be where the witches practiced human sacrifices.-  February 2004 Correction: a submitter states -The real story for the cult house in Stoneham, MA is this. There aren't mini cottages behind the house, but a building that resembles a small church. Every night there is a candle lit in the upstairs window of the church. They would drive around the block and you could see the light shining through the trees, but it's hard to see if there is anything else back there besides the church.

One of those buildings is the Goss Building. Connected to the underground tunnels that were used to transport patients before it fell into disrepair, Goss houses two floors of DYS lock up, and on the third floor is an all girl adolensent unit.

Oceanside	United States	The Hunter Steakhouse in Oceanside, California sits on a hill above the Buena Vista Lagoon. The land it sits on was originally the site of the Buena Vista Cemetery, and it seems that not all the spirits followed when the graves were moved. Patrons and employees have constantly reported incidents. The stairwell to the bar area appears to be the home of a female spirit. There is a storage room above the lower dining area and entrance. The room is constantly locked and hardly used. But for some reason the spirits prefer this location when the restaurant gets busy. There are three windows up there, and although they can't be opened, people feel drawn to gaze at these windows. Also from the second floor an apparition has been reported moving across the room from the fireplace in mid-air. Several people have heard there names called by both male and female voices. Like many other locations of hauntings, objects moving and power surges have been reported as well.

This area of land from the Tyler Mall to La Sierra Blvd was an old Indian Burial Ground. - In addition to what you already know about the park, a former employee also had an experience in the railroad trac ks tunnel in the park. After hours when all the guests are gone the cafe would close. when any of the employees would be sent to toss away the trash in the far end of the parking lot, they would have to go in pairs. Reason being is because when you cross the tracks near the cafe you can see the silhouettes of Indian women walking around.

He was the only tenant on that floor. This place is haunted by the Millers. The Mission Inn Hotel was originally a 12 room cottage where the pool now sits.

These tunnels were originally the streets of Sacramento before the first 8 or so blocks next to the river were raised above sea level to avoid flooding. Apparently, the tunnels had served as opium dens, brothels and possibly for ritualistic activity at some point. Several business owners with access to the tunnels have reported an extremely menacing energy and strange noises coming from the tunnels, and went so far as to hire a paranormal investigator. Rumor is that the tunnels are now sealed off. - August 2005: A visitor to our site reports that the rumor is FALSE - people can still enter the old tunnels through basements of the older buildings in Old Town Sacramento, as long as they have the property owner's permission or are in the company of the property's owner.

San Diego	United States	Across from one of the campsites, in a wooded area, there appears the ghost of a young woman in a long white dress. There is a cold and eerie presence near the boulders that lie beneath the trees, and her apparition has been seen on two occasions by two different men. The first sighting occurred on a warm July night around 9:00 p.m. A group was setting up camp when one of the men ventured over to the dark area and found the young lady looking at him. He was startled and turned away. When he turned back, she had vanished but he could still feel her presence. The second sighting occurred around 3:00 a.m., a couple of days later. Another man from the same group of campers got out of his tent after being awakened from a deep sleep by an unknown presence. He looked over his tent and saw the lady pacing. She stopped, looked right at his face, then continued to pace as if she were waiting for someone. The man went to wake up his friends, but by the time he woke anyone she had vanished. Not being able to sleep after the sighting, he decided to stay awake with another camper and start a campfire. In the distance, they could hear the voice of a woman laughing and singing. There seemed to be no explanation for it at that time of the morning. On other occasions the same campers have heard heavy footsteps around their tents during the night that do not fade as if someone were walking away, but simply lift and disappear. In a photo taken of one of the campers in this area, there appears a large orb floating right next to him.

San Francisco	United States	"Located on Sacramento St. in Chinatown, San Francisco.

San Francisco	United States	Located in the middle of San Francisco, SAFEWAY between 17th avenue and Taraval. There were recent sightings by employees that a young boy was sighted in the empty hallways leading to the storage room. The time was around 12:00 am closing time. The employees, even a customer, saw a young male at the age around 7-10 walking slowly towards them, but from a distance. One of the employees claimed to see the young spirit sitting beside some crates with his head down, and his arms covering his knees. The customer simply believed that he saw someone standing on the corner at the end of the hallway facing against the wall. He wanted to use the nearby restroom before he saw the figure. All visions of his spirit were blurry because they said that there was lack of lighting inside the location. Rumors are that the building was once a motel in the mid 1900s until it was burnt down because the owner had money problems with local gang members; however, the presence of the young boy is still a mystery.

San Gabriel	United States	The San Gabriel Civic Auditorium s past is very long and there are many stories of hauntings. Back was being built underground tunnels were built under the length of the building. They were built so that the owner (nicknamed Uncle John) could go from backstage to the foyer. When Uncle John died the tunnels went unused for years and when the depression came those tunnels were used as catacombs to house dead bodies. Once they were filled the catacombs were sealed. In the men s restroom in the front there is a door. When you open that door there is just a brick wall. When a crew tried to breach the wall they got five feet and there was still brick. Why would some one seal a tunnel in more than five feet of brick? No one will ever know unless the try to breach it again. Now to the stories. There is a drop that was preserved because it was the only remaining drop from the original stage. Some times during the Temple City High School musical that drop swings unintentionally. There is no wind and no one ever touched that drop. A psychic was brought in and they said they saw a man swing on the drop. Another story is that there are TV monitors on stage left that broadcast what is being shown on stage. In 2003 and there during the Music Man there was a person seen in the second story window on one of the houses. Many stage crew, tech crew, and actors saw this man on the TV monitor. Also many of the audience saw this man too. The problem with this is that there is no way for a man to be standing in the second story window because there is no ledge or anything for him to stand on. The man was later recognized as Uncle John. There are also stories of a little girl who roams the halls and a old stage manager who roams the halls at night.

San Jose	United States	"In the large theater there is a presence named ""George"". Legend has it he fell off one of the catwalks while working. Now his spirit haunts the theater. Lights switch on and off during presentations done for students, seats pull down and come up when no one is sitting next to you, and if alone in the theater practicing for a show, ""George"" loves to play lighting tricks on you. Fact is no one has ever died in that theatre. No Janitors are ever allowed to go up there nor do they have reason too. The history however, behind George is he has been ever present since the has been built. No one really knows where he comes from or what the history of the land is or anything...though there is a basic story that does float around. So far our George has three figures...The first being there was the business like man figure that was standing up against the wall. The second time George appeared, it was to the actors - [techs never saw him that night] however actors kept complaining about a little boy running around backstage trying to catch his toy ball. The last sighting that has happened was about a year ago witnessed by 2 people who where alone in the building. It was of a very large man and he sat down and filled up the aisle of the house ...which is about 2 and 1/2 to 3 feet wide. A week later after seeing this one of the witnesses was in the lighting booth. and reports, ”My friend and I were coming down the stairs of the lighting booth to go talk to our teacher, who was at the other end of the building...no where near the stage or house [where the audience sits], as we got half way down the whole booth started shaking violently. Us thinking it was an earthquake ran and got the heck out of there. We went to our teachers office, which is located in the same building, and asked her if she felt an earthquake or anything. She looked at us and said, ""No, what are you talking about?"" Since then...George has managed to become more violent here and there...he never harms anyone...however he still continues to play his usual tricks.”"	Independence High School	California	CA	-121.8574547	37.3677202	-121.8863286	37.3382082	0113/02/24

It is said to be haunted by the ghost of David Mayberry, the man who owned the Mayberry Inn during the 1800s.

Gunfights quite often broke out between the men, which led to the death of many people. It is said that one of the men's bloodstains can still be found on the inn's floor. The violence in the inn also led to David Mayberry getting shot. Although Mayberry was not killed, the bullets left in his body led to schizophrenia. Supposedly, because of his mental condition, Mayberry stabbed his wife to death and burned her body in the fireplace( which is still intact and displays a creepy message on the wall above it). Eerily enough, legend states that you will hear the wife of David Mayberry crying hysterically at exactly midnight.

Hot Springs	United States	A former worker, and one of the people who helped run the place told this story. It was on a Wednesday before the regular poetry reading. A woman was awake on a couch, but she couldn’t get her eyes to open completely. With her blurred vision, she thought she saw her friend walk into the kitchen. The woman asked a man sitting in a chair near her if there was anyone else in the room. The man told her that everyone was in the kitchen. She then felt a pair of female hands grab her roughly and hold her down to the couch. She yelled out to the guy sitting in the chair, asking if there was anyone else in the room. He went to the kitchen and saw that no one was there and told her that they were the only two people there. As soon as he told her that, the hands let go. When the woman arrived for work the next day, she told her coworkers the story. She said that she had seen he r friend out of the corner of her eye, and that the friend was wearing the exact same clothes that she saw him wearing earlier that day. The other person who was with her at the time said that he had been sitting in the chair the whole time, and had seen nothing out of the ordinary.

Jonesboro	United States	Formerly Known As The Strand Theater - An apparition of a man has been seen by many people, including play cast and personnel. He has been seen in the attic, the catwalk, the boiler room, the balcony, and the projection room. He has been affectionately named Charlie. He has appeared wearing different clothing at various sightings. According to one eyewitness account, he was sighted by a visitor who was making his way to the projection booth. As he rounded a corner in the balcony, he came face to face with Charlie, who was wearing a red shirt and casual pants. The visitor stopped within two feet of the apparition and made eye to eye contact. The visitor was not startled, because he believed it to be a friend of his. Charlie vanished before his eyes. Another eyewitness reported that he had seen him sitting on a heating duct in the attic, when he we nt upstairs to check on a faulty heating unit. There have been many other strange occurrences, as well as poltergeist type activities at the Strand/Forum theater since its construction in 1927.

Jonesboro	United States	Rumor has it that the theatre is haunted by a spirit named Charlie. During the most recent summer musical, there were various sightings of the mischievous ghost. A techie was cleaning up the dressing rooms, when she heard a young man laughing gleefully as if playing a game. Upon further inspection, she found that there was no one in the theatre, let alone downstairs with her. One of the lead actors was running lines in the upper level when the sound of a man’s voice began echoing. At first she thought it was one of the other actors, but all of the male actors at that rehearsal were onstage at that time. Before a performance, a few people involved in the production went to the theatre to set up. They decided they needed to turn on the lights from the lighting booth, so they headed upstairs to do it. About halfway up, the lights suddenly came on. The techies ran up to find nob ody up there. They shrugged it off and headed downstairs. But as they reached the bottom of the stairs, the lights went off again. A bit frightened, they went back upstairs, and still no one was there. This went on a couple more times before the techies shut the system down and turned it on themselves.	The Forum Theatre	Arkansas	AR	-90.704413	35.838881	-90.704279	35.84229670000001	2025/01/01

Jonesboro	United States	The band keeps their instruments in a room under the bleachers. One day, three friends were putting their instruments up. It was too early in the morning for anyone to be out in the gym. It was supposed to be locked, and the janitor had finished cleaning. When they put up the instruments, they heard a blood-curdling scream. They ran from the band room to the gym. It was locked. Nothing could get in, unless it was something hard to explain. They ran back to the band room. At first, the trio was skeptical, because it was the day before the band Halloween party and they thought that it was a prank. They went back to their instruments. Then again, they heard the screaming. Except, it sounding like someone was yelling for someone or something to quit. The three ran from the band room, leaving the instruments behind. From that day you can still hear the yelling if you are there quite early in the morning, standing in the Nettleton High Band Room. - One night after a band party, a group of band members decided to run around in the gym. It was pretty late, and almost everyone had gone home. The group had split-up and decided to go up to the cheerleading room. There they found that the room was extremely cold, and for some odd reason they couldn't find the light switch. After leaving the cheerleading room, they heard screams and ran down the stairs where the screams came from. Now these weren't any ordinary screams. They were the kind of screams that you would only hear if someone was being stabbed or hurt. There was no explanation for the screams, because no one else was there at the time. The whole group got to the bottom of the stairs to find leaves falling from the ceiling of the gym, as if it were a tree. One of the girls in the group saw the shadow of what looked like a football player. They all tho ught that this was a joke, until they heard a door slam and then saw another door swinging.

She stated that one night, she was asleep when, as she put it, ""You know that sensation you get when someone else is in the room with you? You don't have to see or hear them, but you KNOW someone else is there. "" That is the feeling she had. Her back was to the door. She said that she felt the edge of the bed go down, as it would if someone sat on it. She was too scared to move, scream, or do anything. After a little bit, she felt the edge raise up, as if the individual had stood up, and then the feeling went away. She got up and checked her door. It was still locked.

Cannon Beach	United States	"there is a phantom of a mummy known to locals as ""Bandage Man."" It jumps into the back of vehicles at night. The mummy has even been known to attack at times, leaving bits of his bandages behind. Bandage Man is said to eat dogs and has even murdered several people. Many believe him to be the ghost of a logger cut to pieces in a nearby sawmill. - June 2005 Update – Some believe the haunting is limited to ""The short approach"". There are stories about possible Bandage Man sightings from Lincoln City all the way to Seaside (about a 90 minute to two hour stretch of road). It has also been said that Bandage Man was once a criminal who was shot multiple times by police. Once he was being transferred from the Hospital to the jail, he escaped, ran into the woods, and hasn't been seen since. This would explain the bandages, as he was still covered in them."

Klamath Falls	United States	The old college on old fort road is a very strange place. No one knows exactly why it closed. Apparently, there is a group of Satanists who work up there.

Anyway, several people have gone up the hill and have told me that there is a spot that has a bunch of rocks placed in a circle in the center is a pile of animal bones, but when the people went back up to find that place again, its always gone, and they will go up several times in search of it. Anyway old OIT had a dorm two school buildings and a gym that had a small swimming pool. There is one wall left, and a small area that has three walls and a cement floor. They are maybe 50 feet apart. Anyway, several people, credible witnesses say that they have seen apparitions, sometimes a fog in those two areas. Also if you go at night, you can hear sounds like people chanting, or footsteps if you sit in car with the lights off right next to those two buildings. Also just up the road from old OIT there is a hill, or at least what appears to be one. It’s a small vortex. One of the urban legends is that an old Indian was hung from a tree on that hill right next to the road. If you park under the tree, he will push you up the hill. But there are so many of those stories in various states that it is doubtful. - April 2007 Update - It's fenced in.

Ontario	United States	Malheur Butte is a dead volcano overlooking Ontario, Oregon (the extreme edge of eastern Oregon). According to legend, it once was a popular meeting place of witches. The Snake River is also in the vicinity and supposedly draws wicca ceremonies due to the fact that it flows south-to-north. Near the Butte (and in the outlying areas, as well) many people have spotted small, shadow-like creatures after dark.

Coloma	United States	In Coloma, CA, there is a famous Victorian house called the Vineyard House, which has been reputed to be haunted by its original owners for many years. The house was built some time in the late 1800s, and was used over the years as a jail, an inn and restaurant, and, as its name implies, a winery. It was also at one time supposedly the site of where some executions took place. According to records, the original owners who built the house suffered one tragedy after another. Several of their young children died, their winery was eventually ruined because of a blight, and the husband contracted syphilis, which over time caused blindness and mental illness. Because he became violent from being mentally ill, his wife had him chained to a wall in the basement of the house, where he reportedly died. The entire family is buried directly across the street in a graveyard that overlooks the house. Reports of seeing ghosts in the graveyard have also come forth in the past, but most of the stories took place inside the house. Ghost stories of the encounters where told by employees and guests of Vineyard House. One intriguing story was told by a couple who were staying in one of the upstairs bedrooms. It was late at night and all was quiet, when suddenly the couple was awakened by the sound of drunken men coming into the hallway downstairs. They were very loud and were singing and laughing and making a general raucous, so the husband upstairs stuck his head out the bedroom door to tell the loud men to quiet down. But upon doing so, he saw three men dressed in Victorian clothing ascending the stairs, and then they faded right before his eyes. Another story from a different couple who decided to stay at the inn was that something frightened them so badly that they packed up and left in the middle of the night. They reportedly refused to say what had happened that scared them so badly. The basement was used as a bar, and it was late at night after closing hours. The owner was cleaning up and wiping down he bar. He said that there was one last glass at the far end of the bar, and as he was cleaning, the glass suddenly began to shake, and then it slid all the way across until it finally stopped right in front of him. He admitted that he had no rational explanation for what he'd seen. It is believed that the things that go on in the bar are the original owner who died down there while chained to a wall. Other things that have been reported are sounds of rustling skirts, and there is apparently an area near the kitchen that is constantly cold. A woman having dinner in the restaurant claimed that she was approached by a young child who asked her to mash his peas and carrots for him. Another scary incident occurred in the restaurant when a large chandelier suddenly came crashing down, barely missing some of the guests. It used to be that when the restaurant and inn were still in operation, you could pick up a pamphlet that gave information about the hauntings. It was a famous place because it had been there since the Gold Rush, and there were pictures of famous people, such as John Wayne and Dudley Moore, hanging on the walls. The hauntings were so well-known that the house was featured on That's Incredible! and Ripley's Believe It Or Not. Sadly, the house has been closed to the public for quite a few years. If you are ever visiting old Coloma, the site of the famous Gold Rush, be sure to drive by the old Vineyard House, and know that you are seeing a house that has been famous for its hauntings for many years.
